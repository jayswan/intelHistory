# Perdita Schaffner
Perdita Schaffner was the biological daughter of the modernist writer H.D. (Hilda Doolittle) and composer Cecil Gray. She was legally adopted by H.D.'s partner Bryher (Winifred Annie Ellerman Macpherson) and Kenneth Macpherson. In intelligence history, she is known for having worked at Bletchley Park and later as secretary to James Angleton during his OSS assignment in London during World War Two.

## Glass In My Typewriter
From the East Hampton Star, May 15, 1975. This is Perdita's short memoir of her time working with Angleton. I OCRd it from the PDF and added modern plain text formatting. There is one misspelling of "Bletchley" in the original, which I preserved. Thanks to Professor Greg Barnhisel for the PDF.
